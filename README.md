This GPS trajectory dataset was collected from students and faculties of Northwest University in China in a period of over two months(from October 2019 to November 2019).A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and speed.It has 220 complete trajectories generated over 5 weeks. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers, and have a variety of sampling rates. Most of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 15~20 seconds .Each trajectory lasts longer than 2 minutes.And was plotted on the map and users were asked to tag his/her activities. The trajectory on the map and identified 5 behaviours as the ground truth: “dinning”, “walking”, “riding a bicycle”, “staying at dorm”,”studying in the lab”. The labeled ground truth such as “2019-10-08  07:28:25 to 2019-10-08 07:31:34 staying at dorm ”.This trajectory dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition,location privacy, and location recommendation.
